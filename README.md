Inpainting is a process used to complete missing or corrupted parts of images. Many current inpainting methods do not allow additional user input except masks, causing a loss of generation control, while those using text prompts
risk ambiguity and the omission of key visual details. To address these issues, we introduce ”SketchFuse”, which **enables users to guide the inpainting process using sketches**, making the outcome more aligned with user’s intent. Additionally, SketchFuse provides a complete workflow, which not only generates images based on user sketches but also **converts the results into 3D point clouds**. Our tests on the Bonn Furniture Styles dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms current methods in both objective and subjective assessments.
